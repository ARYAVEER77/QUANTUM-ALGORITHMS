## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the source code, datasets, and experimental validation scripts for the research paper **"Quantum Algorithms for Disaster Prediction and Management"**.

We present a proof-of-concept hybrid framework that integrates **Quantum Computing, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science** to enhance disaster response strategies. The system is composed of four core quantum modules:

1.  **Quantum Neural Network (QNN):** A Sampler-based QNN for classifying disaster types using the EM-DAT dataset.
2.  **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA):** Solves resource allocation problems.
3.  **Quantum Walk:** Optimizes evacuation routes in dynamic disaster zones.
4.  **Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE):** Simulates disaster severity levels.
